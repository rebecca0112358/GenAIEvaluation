Pre-clinical Toxicology Summary of Ilizomab
Introduction
This summary provides an overview of the preclinical toxicology evaluation of Ilizomab, a monoclonal antibody targeting [specific immune pathway], conducted in rodent and non-human primate models to assess its safety, pharmacokinetics, and potential toxicity profile.
Study Design
•	Species: Rats and Cynomolgus monkeys
•	Duration: 28-day and 90-day repeat-dose studies
•	Doses: Low (1 mg/kg), Medium (5 mg/kg), High (15 mg/kg)
•	Endpoints Assessed:
o	Clinical observations (body weight, food consumption, clinical signs)
o	Hematology, serum chemistry, and cytokine profiling
o	Organ pathology (gross and histopathology)
Key Findings
•	General Tolerability:
o	Ilizomab was well tolerated at doses up to 15 mg/kg in both species
o	No treatment-related mortality observed
•	Hematological Effects:
o	Mild, dose-dependent decreases in lymphocyte counts at high doses, reversible after treatment cessation
•	Liver and Renal Toxicity:
o	No significant liver enzyme elevations or renal dysfunction markers detected
•	Cytokine Modulation:
o	Dose-dependent reduction in inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α), consistent with proposed mechanism of action
•	Immunogenicity:
o	Low anti-drug antibody formation in non-human primates
•	Observed Side Effects:
o	Mild to moderate fatigue was noted in some animals, resolving post-dosing
o	Nausea observed at higher doses but did not impact overall health outcomes
o	Syncope-like episodes recorded in isolated cases at 15 mg/kg, transient and not dose-limiting
Conclusion
Ilizomab demonstrated a favorable safety profile in preclinical models, with no dose-limiting toxicities identified. Mild fatigue, nausea, and rare instances of syncope were observed but were not associated with long-term adverse effects. The findings support further clinical development in SLE patients, with careful monitoring of hematological parameters and potential side effects during clinical trials.
